### TTT Discord Mute
Automatically mute a player on discord when he dies in-game during an active TTT round. This was created mostly for me and my friends. Given the way the addon is configured, it does not scale well with larger playercounts. 

### Installation 
Download the repository, drag 'n' drop the `gmod` folder into `addons` and configure it in the `sv_discordmute.lua` file. In order for the bot to work you'll have to fill out environmental variables, download it and run it using Node.
